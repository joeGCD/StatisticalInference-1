This is an excercise to simulate exponential distribution.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
## exponential distribution rate parameter
lambda <- 0.2

## sample size
n <- 40

## number of observation
obs <- 1000

## calculate the means of 1000 observation
means <- NULL
for (i in 1 : obs) means <- c(means, mean(rexp(n, lambda)))

```

Below histogram shows distribution frequency of means of all observations.
```{r}
hist(means)
```

Below plot shows distribution of means of all observations.
```{r}
g <- ggplot(data.frame(x = 1:obs, y = means), aes(x = x, y = y)) 
g <- g + geom_hline(yintercept = 1/lambda) + geom_line(size = 2, color='red')
g <- g + labs(x = "Number of obs", y = "Mean")
g
```
